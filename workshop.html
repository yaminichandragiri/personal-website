        <h1>one-day workshop on Employability skills</h1>
        <p>I recently had the opportunity to participate in a one-day workshop on employability skills, where I presented a SWOC analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Challenges) of myself. This experience was incredibly enlightening and helped me gain deeper insights into my professional journey. </p>
